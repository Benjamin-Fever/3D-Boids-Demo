<h1>3D Boids</h1>
<p>
<h2>Description</h2>
This was a program for my computer graphics course CGRA251. In this assignment I covered the boids algorithm. In this project your can control the difference
variables using the sliders to control the boids and how they respond. This was a very interesting algorithm learning how such simple programming can cause
such complex behaviour. 

<h4>What I Learnt</h4>
This taught me about the steering alogrithm and how it works and how we can use to create a flocking system similar to how birds or fish might move.

<h2>Showcase</h2>
<h3>Single Flock</h3>
<p>Here you can see how a single flock might react</p>

<h3>Multiple Flocks</h3>
<p>Here you can see how multiple flocks might react</p>
