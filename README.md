# 3D Boids
This was a program for my computer graphics course ( CGRA251 ) In this assignment I covered the boids algorithm. In this project your can control the difference
variables using the sliders to control the boids and how they respond. This was a very interesting algorithm learning how such simple programming can cause
such complex behaviour.
